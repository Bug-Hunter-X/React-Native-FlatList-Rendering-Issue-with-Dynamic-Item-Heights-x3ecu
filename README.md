# React Native FlatList Rendering Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native's `FlatList` component when dealing with dynamic item heights and large datasets. The bug manifests as inconsistent rendering, blank spaces, and performance issues.  The solution involves optimizing item height calculation and potentially using `estimatedItemSize` or `getItemLayout` for improved performance.

## Bug Description

The `FlatList` component fails to accurately measure the height of items when item heights are dynamic or asynchronous operations are involved. This leads to incorrect rendering and poor performance. Blank spaces and inconsistent item positions can appear.

## Solution

The solution involves optimizing the height calculation process and implementing `estimatedItemSize` or `getItemLayout` for performance improvements.  `estimatedItemSize` provides a pre-estimate, while `getItemLayout` offers precise layout calculations.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`.
4. Observe the erratic behavior of the FlatList.
