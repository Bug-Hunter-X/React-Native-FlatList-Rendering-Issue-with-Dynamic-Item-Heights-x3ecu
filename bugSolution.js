To fix this, we can optimize item height calculation or use `estimatedItemSize` or `getItemLayout` props in the `FlatList`.  `estimatedItemSize` provides a pre-estimate, significantly improving performance.

Here's an example using `estimatedItemSize`:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={data}
  renderItem={renderItem}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  estimatedItemSize={50} // Estimate the average item height
/>
```

If you need more precise control, use `getItemLayout` which allows you to define the exact offset and size of each item:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={data}
  renderItem={renderItem}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  getItemLayout={(data, index) => (
    {
      length: 50, // Fixed height for simplicity. Adjust as needed.
      offset: 50 * index,
      index,
    }
  )}
/>
```

For truly dynamic heights, you might need a more sophisticated approach, perhaps using a library to handle the layout calculations more efficiently.  Remember to handle asynchronous operations correctly (e.g., image loading) to prevent measurement inaccuracies.
