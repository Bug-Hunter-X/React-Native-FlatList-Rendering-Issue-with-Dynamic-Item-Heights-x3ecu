This React Native bug occurs when using the `FlatList` component with a large dataset and complex components within each item.  The issue is that React Native may not correctly measure the height of the items, leading to inaccurate scrolling behavior, rendering issues, or even crashes.  Specifically, the problem arises when item heights are dynamic or depend on asynchronous operations (like image loading). This often results in blank spaces, incorrect positioning, and performance problems.
